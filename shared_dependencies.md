Shared Dependencies:

1. **React**: All the components files will import React from 'react' as they are all React components.

2. **Next.js**: All the pages files will import Next.js functions such as 'getServerSideProps' or 'getStaticProps' for data fetching.

3. **TypeScript**: All files will use TypeScript for type checking. There will be shared types and interfaces, such as 'Player', 'Question', 'Score', etc.

4. **Game State**: The game state will be shared across multiple components. This could be managed using React's Context API or a state management library like Redux.

5. **Styles**: The global styles file will be imported in the _app.tsx file and will be applied across all components.

6. **Utility Functions**: The utility functions in the utils folder will be shared across multiple components and pages. These could include functions for generating random letters, scoring, timing, etc.

7. **DOM Element IDs**: There will be shared DOM element IDs that JavaScript functions will use. These could include IDs for the game board, question cards, score board, timer, etc.

8. **API Routes**: The API route in the pages/api folder will be shared across multiple components for fetching and updating game data.

9. **Component Imports**: Components will be imported in multiple files. For example, the GameBoard component might import the QuestionCard, ScoreBoard, Timer, Player, and AIPlayer components.

10. **Package.json**: All dependencies and scripts will be shared across all files through package.json.

11. **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration will be shared across all TypeScript files through tsconfig.json.
